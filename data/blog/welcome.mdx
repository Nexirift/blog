Hello everyone!

Welcome to the official Nexirift blog. We're excited to have you here! We will be making blog posts and updates about various Nexirift projects and initiatives.

For those who don't know what Nexirift is, it is an upcoming social media platform that aims to connect people in a more meaningful way.

The purpose of this documentation (and blog) is to provide a guide on how to use the platform, as well as provide information on the various features and functionalities that make Nexirift unique.

We also aim to be fully transparent about the way our platform is run, this includes the various "flags" that are in use to mark accounts, read more [here](https://docs.nexirift.com/docs/concepts/flags).

Soon, we'll have pages on how to run your own instance of Nexirift if you're interested in hosting your own social media platform. Stay tuned!
